# disperse-welcome-folder
Disperse the "Welcome" folder's contents from Brightspace into the Instructor Resources and Lesson 01 folders in Canvas 

Moves all content out of the Welcome folder into the Student Resources folder (or other locations, if appropriate), then removes the Welcome folder. "How to Understand Due Dates" will be deleted. Creates "Standard Resources" and "Course Specific" headers inside of Student Resources, and moves content into each of those two sections.

Potentially will add "Standard Resources" and "Course Specific" headers to Student Resources.
